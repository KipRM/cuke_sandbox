2. Search Google for “ICD Portal” and verify the ICD Portal is the first result.
3. Search Bing for “Institutional Cash Distributors” and verify the ICD Portal is the first result.
4. Search Google’s News tab for “Institutional Cash Distributors” and verify the first result is an ICD Press release.
